## Overview

This project involves exploratory data analysis, building a lookalike model, and performing customer segmentation using an eCommerce dataset.

## Structure

- `notebooks/`: Contains all Jupyter notebooks for EDA, Lookalike Model, and Clustering.
- `outputs/`: Contains the generated PDFs and CSV file for the assignment.
- `data/`: Raw data files (`Customers.csv`, `Products.csv`, `Transactions.csv`).

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

2. Run each notebook in the `notebooks/` directory sequentially:
   - Open Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
   - Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory
   - Run the notebooks in the following order:
     1. `Sameer_Ahmed_EDA.ipynb`
     2. `Sameer_Ahmed_Lookalike.ipynb`
     3. `Sameer_Ahmed_Clustering.ipynb`


## Results

The results of the analysis, including visualizations and model outputs, can be found in the `outputs/` directory.
